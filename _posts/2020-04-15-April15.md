Today, I continued working on setting up the blog. I followed the instructions from this [site.](https://www.foxinfotech.in/2019/12/how-to-create-a-blog-using-github-pages-and-jekyll-with-a-few-clicks.html) I had tried following the instructions from this site last week; however, none of my posts would show up. We later figured out that none of the blog posts were showing up because I was working on a Github project site. So, I began working on a different repository and completed the same steps as before. I chose a theme for my Blog from another website and imported all the files onto my repository.I then deleted all the example posts that were already in the files. Lastly, I began creating my own files for the previous blog posts I had written.
