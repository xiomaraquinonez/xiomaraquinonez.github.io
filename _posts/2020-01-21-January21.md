## Tuesday, 1/21

Today, I made changes to the Drawing App. I added game instructions and a clear button. I did this by changing the sizing of the canvas and by including new functions such as clearcanvas. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this. The game can be played [here.](https://xiomaraquinonez.github.io/drawing-app-2/)
