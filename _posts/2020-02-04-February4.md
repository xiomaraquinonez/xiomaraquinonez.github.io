An API allows a piece of software to communciate with another piece of software. APIs generate data in an easier way. To use an API, you create a URL, which is built with pre-defined blocks of data that work as keys to identify values. API URLs have different parts, which allow you to understand different parts of an API. For example, the ampersand character is used to split the key value pairs and a question mark is used to indicate the start of the query string. An API does not need to contain a frontend.
