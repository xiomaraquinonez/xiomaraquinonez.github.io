## Friday, 11/22

**Goal:** My goal for today was to get the theme for my Blog working.

**Process:** I used a [Jekyll theme reference sheet](https://www.jekyll.com.cn/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/) and followed the instructions on how to get the website to become responsive.

**Outcome:** I have a basic website that is able to load all my content, but the theme is still not set on my Blog.

**What I tried:** I wrote Markdown today. Markdown is formatting for text on Github that is easy to write and easy to read.
