Due to Coronavirus, I will be working from home from now on. I have been completing all my work and meeting with my teachers online through Google Hangouts. I am also completing my Workstudy assignments from home. I have been using Slack to stay in contact with my supervisor and get instructions and my questions answered about assignments.
