Today I continued working on the todo list app. I tried to fix some of the buttons. However, I am still facing some challenges. The Active and Completed buttons do not work. But, the rest of the app is functioning and I am able to input and cross out items from the list. The app also looks more like my drawing. The todo list app can be accessed [here.](https://xiomaraquinonez.github.io/todolist/)
